# Operator Overloading

This repository contains examples and tasks related to operator overloading in C#. The tasks include creating classes and structures with overridden methods and operators to demonstrate various aspects of operator overloading.

## Task 1

Study the main constructs and concepts covered in the lesson.

## Task 2

Create a `Block` class with 4 side fields, override the following methods:
- `Equals` - able to compare blocks with each other.
- `ToString` - returns information about the block's fields.

## Task 3

Create a `House` class with two fields and properties. Create two methods, `Clone()` and `DeepClone()`, which perform shallow and deep copying respectively. Implement the simplest verification method.

## Task 4

Create a class that contains information about the date (day, month, year). Using the operator overloading mechanism, define the operation of the difference between two dates (resulting in the number of days between the dates) and the operation of increasing the date by a certain number of days.

## Task 5

Visit the MSDN website. Using the MSDN search mechanisms, find a description of the topic for each example covered in the lesson. Save the links and provide a short description for them.

- [MSDN: ICloneable Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icloneable)

## Task 6

Using Visual Studio, create a project using the `Console Application` template. Create a structure that describes a point in a three-dimensional coordinate system. Implement the ability to add two points using operator overloading for `+`.

## Instructions for Running

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ThreeDimensionalPoint.git`
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Run the project by pressing `Ctrl+F5` or selecting `Debug` -> `Start Without Debugging`.

## Requirements

- .NET 6.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or later
